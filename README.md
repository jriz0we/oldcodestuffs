Some old code I can very carefully share for job search reasons

assetSync is the small set of python scripts I put together for a Google Drive -> github -> CDN pipe for a mobile game.

ucscripttools is another set of python scripts I used to make repetitive unreal script tasks easier to work with a large set of text files on windows without eating the startup of a large ide.

animAbc was a suite of tools I put together for demos of alembic when it was VERY early in development. The tool could cache multiple characters and scenes into various alembic caches, but it also knew about the material description used by the production to re-assign materials after loading the caches.

instancerMel was a Maya script that made a artisan tool to quickly distribute geometry across surfaces using particles, that then could be baked out into instaned geometry (using a plugin not written by me)

trafficTool was a script for adding lines of flying traffic for a specific and VERY visited planet.  it allowed layout and lighting artists to add many lines of traffic adjust the speed and density for their shots. This was based on a Maya rig using particles and instanced geom.
