instancerMel was a Maya script that made a artisan tool to quickly distribute geometry across surfaces using     
particles, that then could be baked out into instaned geometry (using a plugin not written by me)
 
Most of the code was about setting up the asset for random attributes and giving the user multiple assets to distribute across
the surface.  

The ui and another script for converting the shader material on the object to vertex colors is also included.
