AnimABC alembic caching in maya when it was BRAND NEW
animAbc was a suite of tools I put together for demos of alembic when it was VERY early in development. The tool could cache multiple characters and scenes into various alembic caches, but it also knew about the material description used by the production to re-assign materials after loading the caches.
